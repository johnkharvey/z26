	<H2>z26 -- An Atari 2600 Emulator (4.07)</H2>
	<P>August 31, 2019</P>
	<P>http://www.whimsey.com/z26</P>
	<H4>Copyright/License</H4>
	<P>z26 is Copyright &copy;1997-2019 by John Saeger and contributors.
	z26 is released subject to the terms and conditions of the GNU
	General Public License Version 2 (GPL). z26 comes with no warranty.
	Please see the included COPYING.TXT for details. Source code for the
	current release is available at the home page listed above.</P>
	<H4>What's new in version 4.07?</H4>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>Wide dynamic range, tunable palettes for NTSC and PAL video.
		We are now emulating the color tuning controls that are found
		inside the Atari 2600. So just like owners of real hardware can
		experiment with different color tunings, users of z26 can also
		experiment with different color tunings. By default we set the NTSC
		phase shift to 26.2 degrees and the PAL phase shift to 21.5 degrees
		which are good matches to the original z26 palettes.</P>
		<LI><P>Brightness and &ldquo;warmth&rdquo; controls. The warmth
		control allows better matching to vintage CRT TV sets from the
		1980s which had a little more red and maybe a little less blue than
		&ldquo;modern&rdquo; CRT TV sets from the 1990s or early 2000s.</P>
		<LI><P>The original z26 palettes have been retained as custom
		options, and since our tunable color model was inspired by mame
		0.212, we also include the mame palettes as custom options.</P>
		<LI><P>The palette selection and these new options may be found in
		the video menu.</P>
	</UL>
	<H4>Software Requirements</H4>
	<P>This version of z26 is known to work on Windows 10, Linux, and
	Intel Macintoshes. As this version of z26 is written in C, it is
	possible to compile and run this version of z26 on 64-bit Linux
	systems as well as the Raspberry Pi, but your system needs to
	support OpenGL.</P>
	<H4>Hardware Requirements</H4>
	<P>A computer with reasonably fast processors, hardware support for
	OpenGL, and a working vsync. A Raspberry Pi version 1 or a Raspberry
	Pi Zero should be fast enough.</P>
	<H4>Windows Installation</H4>
	<P>Unzip the z26 archive. You can leave it in the download directory
	if you want. You will need a copy of SDL2.dll either in the z26
	directory, or in the Windows directory. This .dll is included in the
	.zip file along with the z26 executable. If you like you can pin z26
	to the taskbar. Then you can click to run it. 
	</P>
	<H4>Macintosh Installation</H4>
	<P>Unzip the archive. You can leave the folder in the download
	directory if you want. Or you can move the app to the applications
	folder. Then if you like, just drag the app to the dock. Click to
	run. 
	</P>
	<H4>Linux Installation 
	</H4>
	<P>First, you need the build tools and the SDL 2.0 library. On a
	debian based system open a terminal and type:</P>
	<PRE>     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev</PRE><P>
	Otherwise use the method from your distro to install these packages.
	Don&rsquo;t worry if build-essential is already installed. It is
	becoming more common for that package to be installed out of the
	box. Unzip the z26 source archive, open a terminal in the resulting
	source directory and type:</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">     make linux</PRE><P>
	<A NAME="selectable12"></A>If all goes well, when it's done you'll
	have an executable named z26 that you can put where you like. To run
	z26, open a terminal in the directory you put z26 and type ./z26 at
	the command line prompt. This should make z26 available in your menu
	system and can be run from there for future uses. You should also be
	able to put a launcher on the desktop or in an application launcher
	like other linux desktop apps.</P>
	<H4>Setting up the Raspberry Pi 
	</H4>
	<P>First, we want to make sure your system is up to date. Open a
	terminal and type:</P>
	<PRE>     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</PRE><P>
	Reboot your system. Then install the dependencies. You need the
	build tools and the SDL 2.0 development library.</P>
	<PRE>     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev</PRE><P>
	Don&rsquo;t worry if build-essential is already installed. It is
	becoming more common for that package to be installed out of the
	box. Unzip the z26 source archive, open a terminal in the resulting
	source directory and type:</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">     make linux</PRE><P>
	<A NAME="selectable1"></A>If all goes well, when it's done you'll
	have an executable named z26 that you can put where you like. Before
	running z26, you need to enable the OpenGL drivers by running:</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">     sudo raspi-config</PRE><P>
	Choose option 7 &ndash; Advanced Options. Then choose option A7 &ndash;
	GL Driver. Then choose option G1 &ndash; GL (Full KMS). Exit the
	config program by pressing escape until you reach the command line
	prompt and reboot your system.</P>
	<P>To run z26, open a terminal in the directory you put z26 and type
	./z26 at the command line prompt. This should make z26 available in
	your menu system and can be run from there for future uses. You
	should also be able to put a launcher on the desktop or in an
	application launcher or panel like other linux desktop apps.</P>
	<H4>Main Menu</H4>
	<P>After launching z26, you will be presented with the Main Menu.
	The current selection is highlighted. You can navigate the list with
	the vertical arrow keys, and you can make a selection by pressing
	the &lt;enter&gt; key or the &lt;right arrow&gt; key.</P>

	<H4>Video Menu 
	</H4>
	<P>By default z26 runs full-screen at the resolution of your desktop
	since OpenGL vsync usually works best when run full-screen. A
	windowed display is provided, but it's not guaranteed to give smooth
	gaming performance.</P>
	<P>Note that syncing the game to vsync is the only method provided
	for controlling game speed. Normally this is not a problem since
	OpenGL does a great job providing this feature and normally the
	refresh rate of the monitor is 60 Hz automatically. This is the
	correct speed for NTSC games which most Atari 2600 ROM images are.
	If however you are a serious gamer and you have a high performance
	monitor and like to set it to a higher frame rate like 100 Hz, 120
	Hz or even 144 Hz, you will need to manually adjust the refresh rate
	of your monitor to 60 Hz to get correct game speed on NTSC games.
	PAL and SECAM games are best run at 50 Hz. My main Linux system
	supports changing the monitor refresh rate to 50 Hz which is pretty
	nice. I can play PAL games at the proper speed. But this feature is
	not necessarily supported on your platform and so far I&rsquo;ve not
	found it on the Raspberry Pi. So your mileage may vary, and frankly,
	running PAL games at 60 Hz is not such a terrible thing to do.</P>
	<P>A number of textures are provided to give control over game
	detail and sharpness. Width is continuously variable and the
	scanline effect has variable depth. So you can control the display
	much as you might control the display on a real 2600 connected to an
	old-school TV set. Scanline display requires normal or HD textures
	to be enabled. HD gives the best scanlines but also requires the
	most CPU resources. 
	</P>
	<P>f you have selected a normal or HD texture you get an expanded
	menu with the ability to set scanline options, if you choose a fast
	texture you get a simplified video menu without these options.</P>
	<P>The palette option allows manual selection of the colors from a
	variety of options including the original vintage z26 palettes.
	Since our tunable color model was inspired by the model found in
	mame 0.212, we include the original palettes from that version of
	mame as well. There are also brightness and warmth controls. The
	warmth control allows for possibly better color matching with
	vintage TV sets from the 1980s which may have had a color balance
	slightly tilted toward the red. Increase it to get a little more red
	in the display. There are also phase adjustments to allow color
	tuning like real hardware. The Atari 2600 has a &ldquo;phase
	adjustment&rdquo; inside the box which allows variations on the
	colors being displayed. By default we approximately match the
	original z26 palettes, but now you can experiment with different
	tunings or match your own hardware. We gave the phase adjustment a
	wide enough range that you can set the color of the water in
	Atlantis to be green, which was popular back in the day, although by
	default in z26, the color of the water in Atlantis is rather bluish,
	and with the new wide dynamic range palettes, that shade of blue is
	a bit deeper than before. In the NTSC palette, the background color
	in the default interface theme which is named &ldquo;aqua&rdquo; is
	set to the color of Atlantis water so you can adjust the color
	tuning of the NTSC palette conveniently.</P>

	<H4>Console Controls</H4>
	<P>To control the switches on the main console box, use the function
	keys on the keyboard as follows:</P>
	<PRE>   F1 -- Reset
   F2 -- Select
   F3 -- B/W

	Paddles</H4>
	<P>z26 supports the use of the mouse or PC trackball to play paddle
	games. If you want to change which paddle is emulated with the mouse
	use the Controller Tweaks Menu. You can change which direction the
	mouse must be moved in to get paddle motion by pressing the &lt;Tab&gt;
	key on the keyboard while you're playing a game. You can emulate two
	paddles with a mouse with one paddle on each axis. You can use the
	keyboard to play paddle games. If z26 doesn't automatically support
	a game as a paddle game you may specify which controllers are paddle
	controllers in the Game Options menu. 
	</P>
	<P>Paddles may be controlled from the keyboard as follows:</P>
	<PRE>  Ctrl -- fire paddle 0 Use left and right arrows to move
RShift -- fire paddle 1 Use up and down arrows to move
     n -- fire paddle 2 Use 's' and 'f' to move
     v -- fire paddle 3 Use 'e' and 'd' to move</PRE><H4>
	Joystick</H4>
	<P>PC or USB joysticks and gamepads are supported to the extent that
	the operating system and SDL supports them for playing joystick
	games. The mouse and PC keyboard may also be used. Some games like
	raiders.bin use the &quot;wrong&quot; joystick. To reverse the
	joysticks, reverse the ports under the Game Options Menu. Joysticks
	may be controlled from the keyboard as follows:</P>
	<H4>Player 0</H4>
	<PRE>  Ctrl -- fire  Use the arrow keys to move.
     / -- trigger (booster grip)
RShift -- booster (booster grip)</PRE><H4>

	<H4>Trak-Ball Controllers</H4>
	<P>Atari sold a Trak-Ball that could be used to play joystick games.
	z26 supports the use of a mouse or PC trakball to do the same thing
	for joystick games. Optical trackballs like the Logitech Marble
	Mouse are great for this. Also z26 emulates the various types of
	Atari Trak-Balls in their native modes.</P>
	<H4>Light Gun</H4>
	<P>z26 supports light gun games (Sentinel, Shooting Gallery) with
	the mouse.</P>
	<H4>Keyboard Controllers</H4>
	<P>z26 enables the keyboard/touch pad/keypad for recognized games
	that use them.</P>
	<H4>Booster Grip</H4>
	<P>z26 supports the booster grip game (Omega Race) from the keyboard
	and the PC joystick with 3 or more buttons.</P>
	<H4>Scrolling the Screen</H4>
	<P>If you don&rsquo;t like how we&rsquo;ve positioned the game on
	the screen you can move it around. These days the relevant keys are
	the versions of the keys that are not on the ten key pad. I guess
	you call them the keys on the &ldquo;nav-cluster.&rdquo;</P>
	<PRE> PgUp -- Scroll the screen up.
 PgDn -- Scroll the screen down.
 Home -- Return to the default screen position.</PRE><H4>
	Trace Mode</H4>
	<P>You can start trace mode by launching z26 from the command line
	with the -t command line switch, or by enabling it in the Debug
	menu. It automatically builds a text file called z26.log in your
	home directory. This file is a log of all instructions executed and
	shows some other interesting things like the (frame number, scanline
	number, cpu cycle, tia clock), object positions (P0, P1, M0, M1,
	BL), cpu flags, registers (A, X, Y, SP), the program counter, the
	current instruction in hex, and a disassembled listing of the
	instruction.</P>
	<P>Emulator performance slows down quite a bit while writing out
	this file so you can turn off writing with F12 and turn it back on
	with F11 to make it easier to get to the part of the game that
	you're interested in.</P>
	<H4>Counting Scan Lines and Showing FPS</H4>
	<P>By enabling the Show FPS option in the Interface Options menu,
	thee number of scan lines that a game is using as well as its play
	speed in frames per second (FPS) to be displayed. This is useful for
	testing PAL games so you can avoid the PAL color loss bug. Of course
	you can also enable the color loss by turning on the Colour Loss
	option in the Video Options menu. The display may be toggled with
	the &lt;Alt-D&gt; key combination.</P>
	<H4>Inactivating PC controller support</H4>
	<P>Some Atari controllers are simulated with more than one PC
	controller. If you are experiencing problems with this, you can
	disable one or more PC controllers for these Atari controller
	simulations. For example you might want to disable the PC mouse when
	you use the keyboard to play an Atari-joystick game, so that
	accidently pushing the mouse doesn't cause any unwanted movement.
	Also you might want to disable the PC joystick for paddle games,
	because the PC joystick always overrides all other PC controllers in
	the paddle simulation when one is plugged into the PC. Please look
	at the following table to find out which Atari controllers are
	simulated with which PC controller.</P>

	Please note that inactivating the PC controller only works for Atari

	<H4>Colors (palettes)</H4>
	<P>z26 supports three different sets of colors or palettes. The most
	common games shipped in North America use the so called NTSC colors.
	Games shipped in other parts of the world use the so called PAL
	colors. z26 typically detects the correct colors, but you can
	override the colors chosen by z26 with the Palette option in the
	Game Options menu.</P>
	<P>z26 also supports the bug in PAL consoles that causes the display
	to display a monochrome image if a game has the wrong number of
	scanlines. This feature is enabled with the Colour Loss option in
	the Video Options menu. Some of the 32-in-1 games which were poorly
	done PAL hacks show this effect.</P>
	<P>SECAM colors can be selected with Palette option in the Game
	Menu. In the time before the crash Atari created most of it's PAL
	games in such a way that the B/W switch would enable SECAM
	compatible colors. So nostalgic gamers from France can play PAL ROMs
	by selecting this option.</P>
	<H4>Forcing Black and White mode</H4>
	<P>You can force a game to start in black and white mode with the
	Console B/W option in the Game Options menu. Note that this doesn't
	mean that the game will actually be in black and white, this merely
	sets the console B/W switch which the game may or may not ignore.</P>
	<H4>Starpath Games</H4>
	<P>For most Starpath games, the .bin file must be a multiple of 8448
	bytes big. To run multiload games you must concatenate the .bin
	files. Under Windows, a command like this will do the trick:</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">     copy /b load1.bin+load2.bin+load3.bin+load4.bin mload.bin</PRE><P>
	Under Linux something like this will work:</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">     cat load1.bin load2.bin load3.bin load4.bin &gt; mload.bin</PRE><P>
	Then run mload.bin in the emulator. z26 supports a maximum of 61
	loads.</P>
	<P>z26 also supports the 6144 byte Starpath format.</P>
	<P>The Extended Tigervision (#11) bankswitch scheme allows ROMs up
	to 512K in size keeping the last bank fixed. All ROM images that are
	bigger than 64K and not a multiple of 8448 default to this scheme.</P>
	<P>The original Tigervision (#4) bankswitch scheme also supports up
	to 512K games but with $1800-$1FFF as the fixed bank. This allows
	compatibility with the Cuttle Cart for games up to 64K in size.</P>
	<H4>Kid Vid Tapes</H4>
	<P>z26 supports the Kid Vid games (Smurfs Save the Day and
	Berenstain Bears) automatically.</P>
	<P>Press 1, 2, or 3 to select the corresponding tape. F1 rewinds the
	tape. In addition to the rom images, you need the wave files with
	the music in the same directory as z26.</P>
	<P>The files may be found at
	<A HREF="http://www.atariage.com/2600/archives/KidVidAudio/">http://www.atariage.com/2600/archives/KidVidAudio/</A>.
	They are named:</P>
	<P>Berenstain Bears:</P>
	<P>KVB1.WAV, KVB2.WAV, KVB3.WAV</P>
	<P>Smurfs Save the Day:</P>
	<P>KVS1.WAV, KVS2.WAV, KVS3.WAV</P>
	<P>Both:</P>
	<P>KVSHARED.WAV</P>
	<P>You can also play the games without the music, but it's much less
	fun.</P>
	<H4>Command-line Switches</H4>
	<P>For information on how the command line switches work, please see
	the source file cli.c.</P>
	<H4>Troubleshooting</H4>
	<H4>z26 runs too fast.</H4>
	<P>It&rsquo;s possible that your hardware vsync isn&rsquo;t working
	but it&rsquo;s more likely that you&rsquo;ve set the refresh rate of
	your monitor too high. Try setting the refresh rate to 60 Hz for
	NTSC games or to 50 Hz for PAL or SECAM games.</P>
	<H4>z26 runs too slowly.</H4>
	<P>Try a faster texture. HD textures are very demanding.</P>
	<H4>z26 sounds bad.</H4>
	<P>Turn off the sound in the Sound Menu.</P>
	<H4>Warranty</H4>
	<P>Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no
	warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
	Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or
	other parties provide the program &quot;as is&quot; without warranty

	performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove
	defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
	correction. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed
	to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may
	modify and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable
	to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
	consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
	program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
	rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a
	failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if
	such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of
	such damages.</P>
	<H4>Tools</H4>
	<P>On a mac, z26 is built with clang, otherwise z26 is built with
	GCC. On Windows we use MinGW/Msys. Fonts were designed with CSEDIT
	by Matt Pritchard.</P>

<h2>z26 -- An Atari 2600 Emulator (2.14)</h2>
<p>Spring 2011</p>
<p>http://www.whimsey.com/z26</p>
<h4>Copyright/License</h4>
<p>z26 is Copyright ©1997-2011 by John Saeger and contributors. z26 is

</ul>
<h4>Software Requirements</h4>
<p>You need an x86 based Windows or Linux system. z26 works fine on
32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows 7. On Linux, a 32-bit system is
preferred and phosphor mode is recommended. Running on a Linux virtual
machine inside VMware or Virtual Box can work well. Older Windows
platforms
such as Windows XP and Windows 98 also work fine.<br>
</p>
<h4>Hardware Requirements<br>
</h4>
<p>z26 works great on modern x86 computers and can bring some joy back
to old ones.&nbsp; Here are some examples of vintage or low
specification computers that can run
games at full speed including sound:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vaio N505X with a 333 MHz Celeron (Wary Puppy Linux).</li>
  <li>Thinkpad 600E with a 366 MHz Pentium II (Windows 98).<br>
  </li>
  <li>OLPC-XO1 with a 433 MHz AMD Geode (Fedora Linux).</li>
  <li>eeePC 701 with a 630 MHz Celeron (Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Thinkpad X21 with a 700 MHz Pentium III (Antix Linux).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Modern x86 computers are usually fast enough.&nbsp; If you have an
original Pentium or Pentium MMX machine, you might
like to try the DOS version of z26.</p>
<h4>Virtual Hardware</h4>
Running an Ubuntu 10.04 guest in Virtual Box 3.2.2 on a Windows 7 host
has been tested.&nbsp; It's a little jerky, but it works better than I
expected.&nbsp; Even the sound works.<br>
<h4>Windows Installation</h4>
<p>Unzip the z26 archive and place the executable which is called
z26.exe into the directory that contains the ROM images that you want
to run. You will need a copy of SDL.DLL either in the directory that
you place z26, or in the Windows directory. This .DLL is included in
the .zip file along with the z26 executable.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to make sure DirectX is enabled. To enable DirectX
with z26 you need to set an environment variable. On Windows 98 or
Windows ME, edit autoexec.bat in the root directory and add the
following line:</p>
<pre>SET SDL_VIDEODRIVER=directx</pre>
<p> To set the environment variable in Windows XP or Windows 7, use the
System icon in the Control Panel. Under Advanced -- Environment
Variables, add a new environment variable named SDL_VIDEODRIVER, and
set its value to directx.</p>
<p>If you don't enable DirectX for use with z26, running games with
monitor-synchronized video will probably be much too fast.</p>
<h4>Windows 98 hints</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Install the latest audio and video drivers for your hardware.</li>
  <li>Install the latest version (probably 8.1) of DirectX for Windows
98.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Linux Installation</h4>
<p>A binary built on Ubuntu Linux called z26 is included in the
z26
archive.&nbsp; It runs on a wide variety of 32-bit Linux
distributions.&nbsp; Just
put it into the ROM
directory and run it from
there.&nbsp; You may need to install the SDL runtime libraries.&nbsp;
If this doesn't work, build z26 from source code. To build
z26
on Linux,
or other Linux like 32-bit operating systems, go to the src directory
and type:</p>
<pre>make linux</pre>
<p> If all goes well, when it's done you'll have an executable named
z26 that you can put in your ROM directory. You might need to install
the SDL development headers, gcc, make, m4, and nasm for this to work.</p>
<h4>Main Menu</h4>
<p>Simply double-click on the z26 executable from your file manager or
simply launch z26 without a filename and you will be presented with the
Main Menu. The current selection is highlighted. You can navigate the
list with the vertical arrow keys, and you can make a selection by
pressing the &lt;enter&gt; key or the &lt;right arrow&gt; key.</p>

<h4> Play a Game Menu</h4>
<p>Initially, the contents of the startup directory are shown. You can
navigate to other directories which are shown with a / following the
name. You can go upwards in a directory tree by selecting the ../
entry. If you press a letter of the alphabet, the filelist shows the
first game starting with that letter at the top of the list, with
successive keypresses narrowing the search.</p>

<p> If you run a game with the game launcher, you can exit the game by
pressing &lt;escape&gt; and you return to the game launcher. If you
press &lt;escape&gt; again you return to the Main Menu.</p>
<h4>Game Menu</h4>
<p>Navigate the menu with the up/down arrows and select with left/right
arrows, the enter key or the space bar. Press &lt;escape&gt; to return
to the Main Menu.</p>
<pre>Game Options – e5e657da              Recently run game CRC shown in hex.<br><br>         P0 Difficulty...: Easy      Player 0 difficulty -- easy or hard.<br>         P1 Difficulty...: Easy      Player 1 difficulty -- easy or hard.<br>         Console B/W.....: Color     Console B/W switch  -- color or B/W.<br><br>         Bankswitch......: Auto      Atari, Tigervision, Spectravideo, etc.<br>         Palette.........: Auto      NTSC, PAL or SECAM.<br>         Left Controller.: Auto      Joystick, paddle, keypad, etc.<br>         Right Controller: Auto      Joystick, paddle, keypad, etc.<br>         Swap Ports......: Auto      Swap left and right controllers.<br>         Allow All 4 Dir.: Auto      All 4 joystick directions simultaneously.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Video Menu
</h4>
<p>By default z26 runs full-screen at the resolution of your desktop,
but you can also run in a window or in a hardware-accelerated
full-screen mode. z26 supports a scanline effect as seen on old TV
sets. Interlaced video is also supported for those demos that require
it.&nbsp; If you want to synchronize with the monitor to emulate the
“shimmer”
effect (on Windows), you should turn off phosphor mode, and turn on
monitor sync under the Timing Menu (see below).</p>
The following video modes are currently supported:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">0 - 320x200<br>
1 - 320x240<br>
2 - 640x480<br>
3 - 800x600<br>
4 - 1024x600<br>
5 - 1024x768<br>
6 - 1200x800<br>
7 - 1200x900<br>
8 - 1280x1024</div>
<pre>Video Options<br><br>         Start Line.: Auto           First scanline to display.<br>         Video Mode.: 2-640x480      Screen resolution.<br>         Width......: Normal         Normal or Narrow.<br>         Display....: Window         Window, Desktop or Full Screen.<br>         Line Mode..: Normal         Normal, Scanline or Interlaced.<br>         Phosphor...: 60             Phosphor amount or None.<br>         Colour Loss: None           Simulate PAL colour loss.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Sound Menu</h4>
<p>You can try reducing the SQ size for better performance on
fast systems, or make it larger if you get choppy sound on older
systems. Changing the DSP changes the tone of the sound attempting to
match the sound of older TV sets.</p>
<pre>Sound Options<br><br>         Quiet......: No             Disable sound.<br>         DSP........: 1              Sound processing level -- 1, 2, or off.<br>         SQ Size....: 4096           Sound queue size.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Timing Menu</h4>
<p>With the framerate set to Auto, games to run at their true speed
which depends on the number of scanlines that the game generates.
Otherwise you can set a very high framerate to see how fast the
emulator can run, or a slower rate to make games easier to play. </p>
<p>Synchronizing the game to the sound system is nice if you would like
to hear the Quadrun voice perfectly. Note that sync to sound takes
priority over the framerate timers.</p>
<p>If you want to sync to the monitor for perfect emulation of the
“shimmer” effect, you must set this here, and turn off phosphor mode.
Don't forget to set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment variable to directx
or sync to monitor will likely run too fast.</p>
<pre>Timing Options<br><br>         Framerate....: Auto         Force framerate or let game control it.<br>         Sync.........: Clock        Clock, sound, or monitor<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Interface Menu</h4>
<p>Here you can tune the user inputs to the game. You can also choose
to turn on the scanline and framerate display, as well as set the GUI
color scheme.</p>
<pre>Interface Options<br><br>         Show FPS....: No            Show framerate on game display.<br>         Theme.......: 5-aqua        Choose colour scheme for GUI.<br><br>         Mouse Rude..: No            Mouse control of Atari joystick in a window.<br>         Grab Input..: No            Grab ALL keyboard input.<br><br>         Keyboard....: Yes           Enable/Disable Keyboard.<br>         Mouse.......: Yes           Enable/Disable Mouse.<br>         Joystick....: Yes           Enable/Disable Joystick.<br>         Stelladaptor: Yes           Enable/Disable Stelladaptor.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Controller Tweaks Menu</h4>
<p>Here you can fine-tune how the emulator behaves.</p>
<pre>Controller Tweaks<br><br>         Mouse Paddle X....: Auto    Paddle to control with mouse X-axis.<br>         Mouse Paddle Y....: Auto    Paddle to control with mouse Y-axis.<br><br>         Paddle Sensitivity: Auto    Sensitivity when controlled by keyboard.<br>         Paddle Adjust.....: Auto    Paddle delay in scanlines.<br><br>         Lightgun cycles...: Auto    Adjust lightgun by N cycles.<br>         Lightgun scanlines: Auto    Adjust lightgun by N  scanlines.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Debug Menu</h4>
<p>Here you can turn on or turn off the debug trace log.</p>
<pre>Debug Options<br>         Trace Log....: Disabled     Write a code trace to z26.log.<br><br>         Exit</pre>
<h4> About Menu</h4>
<pre>Version 2.14.69 –- http://www.whimsey.com/z26      <br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Saving Changes</h4>
<p>Simply exit the emulator while in the startup directory. If you've
navigated to a different directory to play a game, changes will be lost.</p>
<h4>Restoring Defaults</h4>
<p>Delete the file z26.gui from the startup directory. If you are using
command-line switches from the command line, or an external front-end,
delete z26.cli.</p>
<h4>Console Controls</h4>
<p>To control the switches on the main console box, use the function
keys on the keyboard as follows:<br>
</p>
<pre>   F1 -- Reset<br>   F2 -- Select<br>   F3 -- B/W<br>   F4 -- Color<br>   F5 -- Player 0 easy<br>   F6 -- Player 0 hard<br>   F7 -- Player 1 easy<br>   F8 -- Player 1 hard</pre>
<h4> Paddles</h4>
<p>z26 supports the use of the mouse or PC trackball to play paddle
games. If you want to change which paddle is emulated with the mouse
use the Controller Tweaks Menu. You can change which direction the
mouse must be moved in to get paddle motion by pressing the &lt;Tab&gt;
key on the keyboard while you're playing a game. You can emulate two
paddles with a mouse with one paddle on each axis. You can use the
keyboard to play paddle games. If z26 doesn't automatically support a
game as a paddle game you may specify which controllers are paddle
controllers in the Game Options menu. <br>
</p>
<p>Paddles may be controlled from the keyboard as follows:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>
<pre>  Ctrl -- fire paddle 0	Use left and right arrows to move<br>RShift -- fire paddle 1	Use up and down arrows to move<br>     n -- fire paddle 2	Use 's' and 'f' to move<br>     v -- fire paddle 3	Use 'e' and 'd' to move</pre>
<h4> Joystick</h4>
<p>PC or USB joysticks and gamepads are supported to the extent that
the operating system and SDL supports them for playing joystick games.
The mouse and PC keyboard may also be used. Some games like raiders.bin
use the "wrong" joystick. To reverse the joysticks, reverse the ports
under the Game Options Menu.&nbsp; Joysticks may be controlled from the
keyboard as follows:<br>
</p>
<h4>Player 0<br>
</h4>
<pre>  Ctrl -- fire  Use the arrow keys to move.<br>     / -- trigger (booster grip)<br>RShift -- booster (booster grip)</pre>
<h4>Player 1</h4>
<pre>    n -- fire<br>    s -- left<br>    e -- up<br>    f -- right<br>    d -- down<br>    b -- trigger (booster grip)<br>    v -- booster (booster grip)</pre>
<h4> Driving Controller</h4>
<p>z26 suppports the game that uses the driving controller (Indy 500)
from the keyboard as follows:<br>
</p>
<h4>Player 0<br>
</h4>
<pre>      Ctrl -- accelerate<br>right arrow -- turn clockwise<br>left arrow -- turn counter-clockwise</pre>
<h4> Player 1<br>
</h4>
<pre>         n -- accelerate<br>         f -- turn clockwise<br>         s -- turn counter-clockwise</pre>
<h4> Keyboard Controllers</h4>
<pre>       Left Port                     Right Port<br><br>7 -- 1   8 -- 2   9 -- 3      1 -- 1   2 -- 2   3 -- 3<br>u -- 4   i -- 5   o -- 6      q -- 4   w -- 5   e -- 6<br>j -- 7   k -- 8   l -- 9      a -- 7   s -- 8   d -- 9<br>m -- *   , -- 0   . -- #      z -- *   x -- 0   c -- #</pre>
<h4> Compumate Keyboard</h4>
<p>Use PC keyboard columns 1 - 0</p>
<pre> Ctrl -- FUNC<br>LShift -- SHIFT</pre>
<h4> Mindlink Controller</h4>
<p>Use the mouse to move horizontally.</p>
<pre>button -- start the game<br>  Tab -- switch between player 0 and player 1</pre>
<h4> Mouse Handling in Paddle emulation</h4>
<pre>  Tab -- switch between horiz. normal, vert. normal<br>         and horiz. reversed, and vert reversed</pre>
<h4> Kid Vid Controller</h4>
<p>Use keys 1 2 3 to start the corresponding tape.</p>
<p>F1 stops and rewinds the tape.</p>
<h4>Trak-Ball Controllers</h4>
<p>Atari sold a Trak-Ball that could be used to play joystick games.
z26 supports the use of a mouse or PC trakball to do the same thing for
joystick games. Optical trackballs like the Logitech Marble Mouse are
great for this. Also z26 emulates the various types of Atari Trak-Balls
in their native modes.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></h4>
<h4>Light Gun</h4>
<p>z26 supports light gun games (Sentinel, Shooting Gallery) with the
mouse.</p>
<h4>Keyboard Controllers</h4>
<p>z26 enables the keyboard/touch pad/keypad for recognized games that
use them.</p>
<h4>Booster Grip</h4>
<p>z26 supports the booster grip game (Omega Race) from the keyboard
and the PC joystick with 3 or more buttons.</p>
<h4>Scrolling the Screen</h4>
<pre> PgUp -- Scroll the screen up.<br> PgDn -- Scroll the screen down.<br> Home -- Return to the default screen position.</pre>
<h4>Screen Capture</h4>
<p>Pressing the = key during game play causes a .bmp file with a screen
image to be placed in your directory. Filenames are z26p0000.bmp,
z26p0001.bmp etc. The filename restarts at z26p0000.bmp causing old
versions to be replaced each time you restart the emulator.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>Trace
Mode</h4>
<p>If you start z26 from the command line with the -t command line
switch, it automatically builds a text file called z26.log. This file
is a log of all instructions executed and shows some other interesting
things like the (frame number, scanline number, cpu cycle, tia clock),
object positions (P0, P1, M0, M1, BL), cpu flags, registers (A, X, Y,
SP), the program counter, the current instruction in hex, and a
disassembled listing of the instruction.</p>
<p>Emulator performance slows down quite a bit while writing out this
file so you can turn off writing with F12 and turn it back on with F11
to make it easier to get to the part of the game that you're interested
in.</p>
<h4>Counting Scan Lines and Showing FPS<br>
</h4>
<p>By enabling the Show FPS option in the Interface Options menu, thee
number of scan lines that a game is using as well as its play speed in
frames per second (FPS) to be displayed. This is
useful for testing PAL games so you can avoid the PAL color loss bug.
Of course you can also enable the color loss by turning on the Colour
Loss option in the Video Options menu.&nbsp; The display may be toggled
with the &lt;Alt-D&gt; key combination.<br>
</p>
<h4>Disabling Graphics</h4>
<p>While the emulator is running, use the following keys:</p>
<pre>   Alt+key  Effect<br>      Z     Enable/disable player 0<br>      X     Enable/disable player 1<br>      C     Enable/disable missile 0<br>      V     Enable/disable missile 0<br>      B     Enable/disable ball<br>      N     Enable/disable playfield<br>      /     Enable all of the above (returns to default)</pre>
<p> There is currently no way to disable individual playfield registers
(PF0, PF1, PF2). Alt-N affects all 3 registers.</p>
<p>This feature can be useful for testing a game you're writing, or for
analyzing a game someone else wrote. While a register is disabled, it's
invisible and unable to collide with other objects.</p>
<h4>Stelladaptor support</h4>
<p>z26 assumes that a PC joystick with only two buttons and two axis is
the Stelladaptor device, that lets you connect Atari joysticks, driving
controllers and paddles to your PC's USB port. If you want to use a
different 2-button/2-axis joystick with z26 and experience problems
with the emulation of some Atari controller, you can disable the
Stelladaptor support in the Interface Options menu. Please note that
the Stelladaptor is seen as a joystick too, so disabling joysticks in
the Interface Options menu will also disable the Stelladaptor.</p>
<h4>Inactivating PC controller support</h4>
<p>Some Atari controllers are simulated with more than one PC
controller. If you are experiencing problems with this, you can disable
one or more PC controllers for these Atari controller simulations. For
example you might want to disable the PC mouse when you use the
keyboard to play an Atari-joystick game, so that accidently pushing the
mouse doesn't cause any unwanted movement. Also you might want to
disable the PC joystick for paddle games, because the PC joystick
always overrides all other PC controllers in the paddle simulation when
one is plugged into the PC. Please look at the following table to find
out which Atari controllers are simulated with which PC controller.</p>
<pre>Atari/PC          keyboard  mouse  joystick  Stelladaptor<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>joystick     JS      x        x       x          x<br>paddle       PC      x        x       x          x<br>keypad       KP      x        -       -          -<br>driving      DC      x        x       x          x<br>lightgun     LG      -        x       -          -<br>Compumate    CM      x        -       -          -<br>Kid Vid      KV      x        -       -          -<br>Mindlink     ML      -        x       -          -<br>ST mouse     ST      -        x       -          -<br>Trak-Ball    TB      -        x       -          -<br>Amiga mouse  AM      -        x       -          -<br></pre>
<p> Please note that inactivating the PC controller only works for
Atari controllers that are simulated by more than one PC controller.
Also note that the Stelladaptor is just a special case of the PC
joystick. So inactivating joystick support will also disable
Stelladaptor support.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>Colors
(palettes)</h4>
<p>z26 supports three different sets of colors or palettes. The most
common games shipped in North America use the so called NTSC colors.
Games shipped in other parts of the world use the so called PAL colors.
z26 typically detects the correct colors, but you can override the
colors chosen by z26 with the Palette option in the Game Options menu.</p>
<p>z26 also supports the bug in PAL consoles that causes the display to
display a monochrome image if a game has the wrong number of scanlines.
This feature is enabled with the Colour Loss option in the Video
Options menu. Some of the 32-in-1 games which were poorly done PAL
hacks show this effect.</p>
<p>SECAM colors can be selected with Palette option in the Game Menu.
In the time before the crash Atari created most of it's PAL games in
such a way that the B/W switch would enable SECAM compatible colors. So
nostalgic gamers from France can play PAL ROMs by selecting this option.</p>
<h4>Forcing Black and White mode</h4>
<p>You can force a game to start in black and white mode with the
Console B/W option in the Game Options menu. Note that this doesn't
mean that the game will actually be in black and white, this merely
sets the console B/W switch which the game may or may not ignore.</p>
<h4>Adjusting Game Speed</h4>
<p>By default, games run at a speed that is determined by how many
scanlines the game generates per frame. This provides correct play
speed for NTSC and PAL games automatically. However you may adjust game
speed to a specific number of frames per second as desired. On Windows
platforms, you can turn off phosphor mode and synchronize the game to
the monitor when you run in a full screen video mode.</p>
<h4>Digital Signal Processing</h4>
<p>z26 supports digital signal processing (DSP) on the sound. This is
to reduce distortion on some clone sound cards, but also causes the
sound to more closely approximate the sound of an old TV set for those
users that prefer a more "classic" sound. By default a setting of 1 is
selected, however a higher setting of 2 is also available, and the DSP
can be turned off as well.</p>
<h4>Offbeat Cartridge Formats (Bank Switching)</h4>
<p>z26 currently supports the following schemes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Standard 8K bank switching. </li>
  <li> Standard 16K bank switching. </li>
  <li> Atari Super-Chip. </li>
  <li> CBS Ram Plus. </li>
  <li> Parker Brothers 8K. </li>
  <li> TigerVision 8K. </li>
  <li> Activision FE 8K. </li>
  <li> Atari 32K. </li>
  <li> M-Network 16K. </li>
  <li> Pitfall II. </li>
  <li> Starpath. </li>
  <li> Megaboy. </li>
  <li> Compumate. </li>
  <li> Extended TigerVision (to 512K). </li>
  <li> UA Ltd. 8K. </li>
  <li> 'EF' 64K (used by Paul Slocum's Homestar Runner RPG). </li>
</ul>
<p>Support is usually automatic, however one can override the default
bankswitch scheme in the Game Options menu.</p>
<h4>Starpath Games</h4>
<p>For most Starpath games, the .bin file must be a multiple of 8448
bytes big. To run multiload games you must concatenate the .bin files.
Under Windows, a command like this will do the trick:</p>
<pre>copy /b load1.bin+load2.bin+load3.bin+load4.bin mload.bin</pre>
<p> Under Linux something like this will work:</p>
<pre>cat load1.bin load2.bin load3.bin load4.bin &gt; mload.bin</pre>
<p> Then run mload.bin in the emulator. z26 supports a maximum of 61
loads.</p>
<p>z26 also supports the 6144 byte Starpath format.</p>
<p>The Extended Tigervision (#11) bankswitch scheme allows ROMs up to
512K in size keeping the last bank fixed. All ROM images that are
bigger than 64K and not a multiple of 8448 default to this scheme.</p>
<p>The original Tigervision (#4) bankswitch scheme also supports up to
512K games but with $1800-$1FFF as the fixed bank. This allows
compatibility with the Cuttle Cart for games up to 64K in size.</p>

 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></h4>
<h4>Kid Vid Tapes</h4>
<p>z26 supports the Kid Vid games (Smurfs Save the Day and Berenstain
Bears) automatically.</p>
<p>Press 1, 2, or 3 to select the corresponding tape. F1 rewinds the
tape. In addition to the rom images, you need the wave files with the
music in the same directory as z26.</p>
<p>The files are named:</p>
<p>Berenstain Bears:</p>
<p>KVB1.WAV, KVB2.WAV, KVB3.WAV</p>
<p>Smurfs Save the Day:</p>
<p>KVS1.WAV, KVS2.WAV, KVS3.WAV</p>
<p>Both:</p>
<p>KVSHARED.WAV</p>
<p>You can also play the games without the music, but it's much less
fun.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>Configuring
z26
with
command
line
switches</h4>
<p>z26 has many options that are set with command line switches. You
can use a text editor (or an external front end program) to create a
file called z26.cli in the directory that contains your ROM images to
set these options. Otherwise if you type z26 with some command line
switches and don't include a filename, the command line switches are
recorded in z26.cli automatically as emulator defaults. These defaults
can still be overridden with command line switches that you include on
command lines that include a filename.</p>
<p>Spaces are not allowed between an option and its argument.</p>
<p>Example: to force the framerate to 60, use -r60, not -r 60.</p>
<p>Options set in the GUI are ignored when z26 is launched from the
command line. But if you like you can copy the z26.gui file to z26.cli
and the GUI set options will be recognized from the command line, since
the files have the same format.</p>

<h4> </h4>
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<h4>z26 runs too fast.</h4>
<p>If synchronizing to the monitor, enable SDL_VIDEODRIVER=directx on
Windows systems.</p>
<p>Set framerate control to Auto or a slower speed.</p>
<h4>z26 runs too slowly.</h4>
<p>Try a different pixel depth on your desktop or a different video
mode with lower resolution.<br>
</p>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"></span>
<h4>z26 sounds bad.</h4>
<p>Try increasing the size of the sound queue in the Sound Menu.&nbsp;
Making the size 6144 bytes usually works.&nbsp; This may be necessary
on older computers.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Turn off the sound in the Sound Menu.</p>

<h4>Tools</h4>
<p>The Windows version of z26 is built with MinGW/Msys, with GCC
version 3.2 and NASM.</p>
<p>Fonts were designed with CSEDIT by Matt Pritchard.</p>
<p>Documentation was made with SeaMonkey.<br>
</p>
<h4>Credits</h4>
<p>Eckhard Stolberg has made contributions to z26 that are too numerous
to count. He has been involved since the very early days and the high
quality emulation that z26 provides would certainly not have been
possible without his participation.</p>
<p>Brian Watson made the 32-bit version of z26 possible and laid the
foundation for the GUI.</p>

<h4><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Software
Requirements</h4>
<p>This version of z26 is known to work on Windows XP, Windows 7,
Linux, and Intel Macintoshes.&nbsp; As this version of z26 is written
in C, it is possible
to compile and run this
version of z26 on 64-bit Linux systems.<br>
</p>
<h4>Hardware Requirements<br>
</h4>
<p>A computer with reasonably
fast processors, hardware support for OpenGL, and a working
vsync.&nbsp;
Note that vsync is most likely to work properly if z26 is run full
screen.<br>
</p>
<h4>Windows Installation</h4>
<p>Unzip the z26 archive and place the executable which is called
z26.exe into the directory that contains the ROM images that you want
to run. You will need a copy of SDL.DLL either in the directory that
you place z26, or in the Windows directory. This .DLL is included in
the .zip file along with the z26 executable.</p>
<h4>Linux Installation</h4>
<p>On Linux, please build z26 from source code. Go to the src directory
and type:</p>
<pre>make linux</pre>
<p> If all goes well, when it's done you'll have an executable named
z26 that you can put in your ROM directory. You might need to install
the SDL development headers, gcc, make, and m4 for this to work.</p>
<h4>Main Menu</h4>
<p>Simply double-click on the z26 executable from your file manager or
launch z26 from the command line and you will be presented with the
Main Menu. The current selection is highlighted. You can navigate the
list with the vertical arrow keys, and you can make a selection by
pressing the &lt;enter&gt; key or the &lt;right arrow&gt; key.</p>

<h4> Play a Game Menu</h4>
<p>Initially, the contents of the startup directory are shown. You can
navigate to other directories which are shown with a / following the
name. You can go upwards in a directory tree by selecting the ../
entry. If you press a letter of the alphabet, the file list shows the
first game starting with that letter at the top of the list, with
successive keypresses narrowing the search.</p>

<h4>Video Menu
</h4>
<p>By default z26 runs full-screen at the resolution of your
desktop since OpenGL vsync usually works best when run
full-screen.&nbsp; A windowed
display is provided, but it's not guaranteed to give smooth gaming
performance.<br>
</p>
<p>A number of textures are provided to give control over game detail
and sharpness.&nbsp; Width and height are continuously variable and the
scanline effect has variable depth.&nbsp; So you can control the
display much as you might control the display on a real 2600 connected
to an old-school video monitor.<br>
</p>
<pre>Video Options<br><br>         Display........: Full Screen    Full Screen or Window (restart required).<br>         Texture........: Blurry         Blurry or Sharp in fast, normal, and high-definition.<br>         Width..........: 30             Continuously variable.<br>         Height.........: 0              Continuously variable.<br>         Line Mode......: Normal         Normal, Scanline or Interlaced.<br>         Scanline Depth.: 60             Continuously variable.<br>         Colour Loss....: No             Simulate PAL colour loss.<br><br>         Exit                            Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Sound Menu</h4>
<p>You can try reducing the SQ size for better performance on
fast systems, or make it larger if you get choppy sound on older
systems. Changing the DSP changes the tone of the sound.</p>
<pre>Sound Options<br><br>         Quiet......: No             Disable sound.<br>         DSP........: 1              Sound processing level -- 1, 2, or off.<br>         SQ Size....: 4096           Sound queue size.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4>Interface Menu</h4>
<p>Here you can tune the user inputs to the game. You can also choose
to turn on the scanline and framerate display, as well as set the GUI
color scheme.</p>
<pre>Interface Options<br><br>         Show FPS....: No            Show framerate on game display.<br>         Theme.......: 5-aqua        Choose colour scheme for GUI.<br><br>         Mouse Rude..: No            Mouse control of Atari joystick in a window.<br>         Grab Input..: No            Grab ALL keyboard input.<br><br>         Keyboard....: Yes           Enable/Disable Keyboard.<br>         Mouse.......: Yes           Enable/Disable Mouse.<br>         Joystick....: Yes           Enable/Disable Joystick.<br>         Stelladaptor: Yes           Enable/Disable Stelladaptor.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Controller Tweaks Menu</h4>
<p>Here you can fine-tune how the emulator behaves.</p>
<pre>Controller Tweaks<br><br>         Mouse Paddle X....: Auto    Paddle to control with mouse X-axis.<br>         Mouse Paddle Y....: Auto    Paddle to control with mouse Y-axis.<br><br>         Paddle Sensitivity: Auto    Sensitivity when controlled by keyboard.<br>         Paddle Adjust.....: Auto    Paddle delay in scanlines.<br><br>         Lightgun cycles...: Auto    Adjust lightgun by N cycles.<br>         Lightgun scanlines: Auto    Adjust lightgun by N  scanlines.<br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4> Debug Menu</h4>
<p>Here you can turn on or turn off the debug trace log.</p>
<pre>Debug Options<br>         Trace Log....: Disabled     Write a code trace to z26.log.<br><br>         Exit</pre>
<h4> About Menu</h4>
<pre>Version 3.00.16 –- http://www.whimsey.com/z26      <br><br>         Exit                        Return to Main Menu.</pre>
<h4>Restoring Defaults</h4>
<p>Delete the file z26.gui from the startup directory.<br>
</p>
<h4>Console Controls</h4>
<p>To control the switches on the main console box, use the function
keys on the keyboard as follows:<br>
</p>
<pre>   F1 -- Reset<br>   F2 -- Select<br>   F3 -- B/W<br>   F4 -- Color<br>   F5 -- Player 0 easy<br>   F6 -- Player 0 hard<br>   F7 -- Player 1 easy<br>   F8 -- Player 1 hard</pre>
<h4> Paddles</h4>
<p>z26 supports the use of the mouse or PC trackball to play paddle
games. If you want to change which paddle is emulated with the mouse
use the Controller Tweaks Menu. You can change which direction the
mouse must be moved in to get paddle motion by pressing the &lt;Tab&gt;
key on the keyboard while you're playing a game. You can emulate two
paddles with a mouse with one paddle on each axis. You can use the
keyboard to play paddle games. If z26 doesn't automatically support a
game as a paddle game you may specify which controllers are paddle
controllers in the Game Options menu. <br>
</p>
<p>Paddles may be controlled from the keyboard as follows:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>
<pre>  Ctrl -- fire paddle 0	Use left and right arrows to move<br>RShift -- fire paddle 1	Use up and down arrows to move<br>     n -- fire paddle 2	Use 's' and 'f' to move<br>     v -- fire paddle 3	Use 'e' and 'd' to move</pre>
<h4> Joystick</h4>
<p>PC or USB joysticks and gamepads are supported to the extent that
the operating system and SDL supports them for playing joystick games.
The mouse and PC keyboard may also be used. Some games like raiders.bin
use the "wrong" joystick. To reverse the joysticks, reverse the ports
under the Game Options Menu.&nbsp; Joysticks may be controlled from the
keyboard as follows:<br>
</p>
<h4>Player 0<br>
</h4>
<pre>  Ctrl -- fire  Use the arrow keys to move.<br>     / -- trigger (booster grip)<br>RShift -- booster (booster grip)</pre>
<h4>Player 1</h4>
<pre>    n -- fire<br>    s -- left<br>    e -- up<br>    f -- right<br>    d -- down<br>    b -- trigger (booster grip)<br>    v -- booster (booster grip)</pre>
<h4> Driving Controller</h4>
<p>z26 suppports the game that uses the driving controller (Indy 500)
from the keyboard as follows:<br>
</p>
<h4>Player 0<br>
</h4>
<pre>      Ctrl -- accelerate<br>right arrow -- turn clockwise<br>left arrow -- turn counter-clockwise</pre>
<h4> Player 1<br>
</h4>
<pre>         n -- accelerate<br>         f -- turn clockwise<br>         s -- turn counter-clockwise</pre>
<h4> Keyboard Controllers</h4>
<pre>       Left Port                     Right Port<br><br>7 -- 1   8 -- 2   9 -- 3      1 -- 1   2 -- 2   3 -- 3<br>u -- 4   i -- 5   o -- 6      q -- 4   w -- 5   e -- 6<br>j -- 7   k -- 8   l -- 9      a -- 7   s -- 8   d -- 9<br>m -- *   , -- 0   . -- #      z -- *   x -- 0   c -- #</pre>
<h4> Compumate Keyboard</h4>
<p>Use PC keyboard columns 1 - 0</p>
<pre> Ctrl -- FUNC<br>LShift -- SHIFT</pre>
<h4> Mindlink Controller</h4>
<p>Use the mouse to move horizontally.</p>
<pre>button -- start the game<br>  Tab -- switch between player 0 and player 1</pre>
<h4> Mouse Handling in Paddle emulation</h4>
<pre>  Tab -- switch between horiz. normal, vert. normal<br>         and horiz. reversed, and vert reversed</pre>
<h4> Kid Vid Controller</h4>
<p>Use keys 1 2 3 to start the corresponding tape.</p>
<p>F1 stops and rewinds the tape.</p>
<h4>Trak-Ball Controllers</h4>
<p>Atari sold a Trak-Ball that could be used to play joystick games.
z26 supports the use of a mouse or PC trakball to do the same thing for
joystick games. Optical trackballs like the Logitech Marble Mouse are
great for this. Also z26 emulates the various types of Atari Trak-Balls
in their native modes.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></h4>
<h4>Light Gun</h4>
<p>z26 supports light gun games (Sentinel, Shooting Gallery) with the
mouse.</p>
<h4>Keyboard Controllers</h4>
<p>z26 enables the keyboard/touch pad/keypad for recognized games that
use them.</p>
<h4>Booster Grip</h4>
<p>z26 supports the booster grip game (Omega Race) from the keyboard
and the PC joystick with 3 or more buttons.</p>
<h4>Scrolling the Screen</h4>
<pre> PgUp -- Scroll the screen up.<br> PgDn -- Scroll the screen down.<br> Home -- Return to the default screen position.</pre>
<h4>Screen Capture</h4>
<p>Pressing the = key during game play causes a .bmp file with a screen
image to be placed in your directory. Filenames are z26p0000.bmp,
z26p0001.bmp etc. The filename restarts at z26p0000.bmp causing old
versions to be replaced each time you restart the emulator.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>Trace
Mode</h4>
<p>If you start z26 from the command line with the -t command line
switch, it automatically builds a text file called z26.log. This file
is a log of all instructions executed and shows some other interesting
things like the (frame number, scanline number, cpu cycle, tia clock),
object positions (P0, P1, M0, M1, BL), cpu flags, registers (A, X, Y,
SP), the program counter, the current instruction in hex, and a
disassembled listing of the instruction.</p>
<p>Emulator performance slows down quite a bit while writing out this
file so you can turn off writing with F12 and turn it back on with F11
to make it easier to get to the part of the game that you're interested
in.</p>
<h4>Counting Scan Lines and Showing FPS<br>
</h4>
<p>By enabling the Show FPS option in the Interface Options menu, thee
number of scan lines that a game is using as well as its play speed in
frames per second (FPS) to be displayed. This is
useful for testing PAL games so you can avoid the PAL color loss bug.
Of course you can also enable the color loss by turning on the Colour
Loss option in the Video Options menu.&nbsp; The display may be toggled
with the &lt;Alt-D&gt; key combination.<br>
</p>
<h4>Stelladaptor support</h4>
<p>z26 assumes that a PC joystick with only two buttons and two axis is
the Stelladaptor device, that lets you connect Atari joysticks, driving
controllers and paddles to your PC's USB port. If you want to use a
different 2-button/2-axis joystick with z26 and experience problems
with the emulation of some Atari controller, you can disable the
Stelladaptor support in the Interface Options menu. Please note that
the Stelladaptor is seen as a joystick too, so disabling joysticks in
the Interface Options menu will also disable the Stelladaptor.</p>
<h4>Inactivating PC controller support</h4>
<p>Some Atari controllers are simulated with more than one PC
controller. If you are experiencing problems with this, you can disable
one or more PC controllers for these Atari controller simulations. For
example you might want to disable the PC mouse when you use the
keyboard to play an Atari-joystick game, so that accidently pushing the
mouse doesn't cause any unwanted movement. Also you might want to
disable the PC joystick for paddle games, because the PC joystick
always overrides all other PC controllers in the paddle simulation when
one is plugged into the PC. Please look at the following table to find
out which Atari controllers are simulated with which PC controller.</p>
<pre>Atari/PC          keyboard  mouse  joystick  Stelladaptor<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>joystick     JS      x        x       x          x<br>paddle       PC      x        x       x          x<br>keypad       KP      x        -       -          -<br>driving      DC      x        x       x          x<br>lightgun     LG      -        x       -          -<br>Compumate    CM      x        -       -          -<br>Kid Vid      KV      x        -       -          -<br>Mindlink     ML      -        x       -          -<br>ST mouse     ST      -        x       -          -<br>Trak-Ball    TB      -        x       -          -<br>Amiga mouse  AM      -        x       -          -<br></pre>
<p> Please note that inactivating the PC controller only works for
Atari controllers that are simulated by more than one PC controller.
Also note that the Stelladaptor is just a special case of the PC
joystick. So inactivating joystick support will also disable
Stelladaptor support.</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>Colors
(palettes)</h4>
<p>z26 supports three different sets of colors or palettes. The most
common games shipped in North America use the so called NTSC colors.
Games shipped in other parts of the world use the so called PAL colors.
z26 typically detects the correct colors, but you can override the
colors chosen by z26 with the Palette option in the Game Options menu.</p>
<p>z26 also supports the bug in PAL consoles that causes the display to
display a monochrome image if a game has the wrong number of scanlines.
This feature is enabled with the Colour Loss option in the Video
Options menu. Some of the 32-in-1 games which were poorly done PAL
hacks show this effect.</p>
<p>SECAM colors can be selected with Palette option in the Game Menu.
In the time before the crash Atari created most of it's PAL games in
such a way that the B/W switch would enable SECAM compatible colors. So
nostalgic gamers from France can play PAL ROMs by selecting this option.</p>
<h4>Forcing Black and White mode</h4>
<p>You can force a game to start in black and white mode with the
Console B/W option in the Game Options menu. Note that this doesn't
mean that the game will actually be in black and white, this merely
sets the console B/W switch which the game may or may not ignore.</p>
<h4>Digital Signal Processing</h4>
<p>z26 supports digital signal processing (DSP) on the sound. This is
to reduce distortion on some clone sound cards, but also causes the
sound to more closely approximate the sound of an old TV set for those
users that prefer a more "classic" sound. By default a setting of 1 is
selected, however a higher setting of 2 is also available, and the DSP
can be turned off as well.</p>
<h4>Offbeat Cartridge Formats (Bank Switching)</h4>
<p>z26 currently supports the following schemes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Atari 8K. </li>
  <li> Atari 16K. </li>
  <li> Atari Super-Chip. </li>
  <li> CBS Ram Plus. </li>
  <li> Parker Brothers 8K. </li>
  <li> TigerVision 8K. </li>
  <li> Activision FE 8K. </li>
  <li> Atari 32K. </li>
  <li> M-Network 16K. </li>
  <li> Pitfall II. </li>
  <li> Starpath. </li>
  <li> Megaboy. </li>
  <li> Compumate. </li>
  <li> Extended TigerVision (to 512K). </li>
  <li> UA Ltd. 8K. </li>
  <li> 'EF' 64K (used by Paul Slocum's Homestar Runner RPG).</li>
  <li>Krokodile Cart.</li>
  <li>4A50 / supercat.</li>
  <li>Econobanking.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Support is usually automatic, however one can override the default
bankswitch scheme in the Game Options menu.</p>
<h4>Starpath Games</h4>
<p>For most Starpath games, the .bin file must be a multiple of 8448
bytes big. To run multiload games you must concatenate the .bin files.
Under Windows, a command like this will do the trick:</p>
<pre>copy /b load1.bin+load2.bin+load3.bin+load4.bin mload.bin</pre>
<p> Under Linux something like this will work:</p>
<pre>cat load1.bin load2.bin load3.bin load4.bin &gt; mload.bin</pre>
<p> Then run mload.bin in the emulator. z26 supports a maximum of 61
loads.</p>
<p>z26 also supports the 6144 byte Starpath format.</p>
<p>The Extended Tigervision (#11) bankswitch scheme allows ROMs up to
512K in size keeping the last bank fixed. All ROM images that are
bigger than 64K and not a multiple of 8448 default to this scheme.</p>
<p>The original Tigervision (#4) bankswitch scheme also supports up to
512K games but with $1800-$1FFF as the fixed bank. This allows
compatibility with the Cuttle Cart for games up to 64K in size.</p>

<h4>Kid Vid Tapes</h4>
<p>z26 supports the Kid Vid games (Smurfs Save the Day and Berenstain
Bears) automatically.</p>
<p>Press 1, 2, or 3 to select the corresponding tape. F1 rewinds the
tape. In addition to the rom images, you need the wave files with the
music in the same directory as z26.</p>
<p>The files are named:</p>
<p>Berenstain Bears:</p>
<p>KVB1.WAV, KVB2.WAV, KVB3.WAV</p>
<p>Smurfs Save the Day:</p>
<p>KVS1.WAV, KVS2.WAV, KVS3.WAV</p>
<p>Both:</p>
<p>KVSHARED.WAV</p>
<p>You can also play the games without the music, but it's much less
fun.<br>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">z26 runs too fast.</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Hardware vsync is probably not
working.&nbsp; If you can't fix it, try a version of z26 from the 2.xx
series.<br>
</div>
<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">z26 runs too slowly.</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Try a faster texture.&nbsp; HD textures
are very demanding.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;;"></span></div>
<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">z26 sounds bad.&nbsp; <br>
</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Turn off the sound in the Sound Menu.<br>
</p>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some games have emulation errors.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Multi-sprite trick doesn't work.</li>
  <li>Cosmic Ark starfield doesn't work.</li>
  <li>Not all games are recognized properly.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Not all bankswitching schemes are implemented.</li>
  <li>The GUI can be slightly jumpy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tools</h4>
<p>z26 is built with M4 and GCC.&nbsp; On Windows we use MinGW/Msys.<br>
</p>
<p>Fonts were designed with CSEDIT by Matt Pritchard.</p>
<p>Documentation was made with SeaMonkey.<br>
</p>
<h4>Credits</h4>
The following people have made valuable suggestions for new features
and/or have helped to identify bugs in z26 3.0:<br>
<br>
maiki, Thomas Jentzsch, mwalden, Keatah, flammingcowz, SpiceWare,
Silvio Mogno.<br>
<br>
<p>Eckhard Stolberg has made contributions to z26 that are too numerous
to count. He has been involved since the very early days and the high
quality emulation that z26 provides would certainly not have been
possible without his participation.&nbsp; The TIA and CPU engines in
the 3.0 version of z26 was written by Eckhard.<br>
</p>
<p>Brian Watson made the 32-bit version of z26 possible and laid the
foundation for the GUI.</p>
